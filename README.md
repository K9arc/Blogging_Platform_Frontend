# Blogging Platform - Frontend

This is the frontend of a full-stack blogging platform built using **ReactJS**. It allows users to register, log in, write blog posts using a rich text editor, view all posts, and manage their own content.

## üöÄ Features

- User authentication (signup, login, logout)
- Create, edit, delete blog posts using **CKEditor**
- View all blog posts with title, summary, author, and date
- View full blog post on a detail page
- User dashboard to manage their own posts
- Client-side search functionality
- Responsive and user-friendly UI

## üß† My Approach

- Followed a component-based structure using functional components and hooks.
- Managed routing using **React Router DOM**.
- Integrated **CKEditor 5** for rich text editing.
- Used **Axios** for HTTP requests.
- Authenticated routes based on JWT token.
- Implemented search using built-in array filtering.

## üß† How I Used AI

I used **ChatGPT** to:
- Get help with integrating CKEditor into React
- Suggest component and folder structure
- Debug UI rendering issues
- Create better UX flows for post editing and dashboard navigation
